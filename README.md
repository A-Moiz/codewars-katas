# 🧠 Codewars Katas — CYF Practice

This repository contains my solutions to **Codewars Katas** completed as part of my learning journey at **CodeYourFuture (CYF)**.

The goal of this repo is not just to solve challenges, but to actively develop strong problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, and practice writing clean, readable code.

---

## 📚 What this repository demonstrates

Through these exercises I practice:

- Logical thinking and algorithm design
- Breaking down problems into smaller steps
- Writing clean and maintainable code
- Understanding edge cases
- Improving debugging skills
- Using modern JavaScript syntax (ES6+)
- Time and space complexity awareness

---

## 🧩 Kata Difficulty Levels

Codewars katas are ranked from **8 kyu (beginner)** to **1 kyu (advanced)**.

This repository includes solutions across multiple levels as my skills progress:

| Level | Focus |
|------|-----|
| 8–7 kyu | Fundamentals, loops, conditionals, arrays |
| 6–5 kyu | Data transformation, objects, edge cases |
| 4+ kyu | Algorithms, optimisation, deeper reasoning |

## 🎯 Purpose of this repository

This repo acts as:

- A learning journal
- A record of improvement over time
- Evidence of consistent practice
- Preparation for technical interviews

Each solution prioritises clarity first, then optimisation once correctness is achieved.

---

## 🚀 Continuous Improvement

As my skills grow, I may revisit earlier katas to:
- Refactor solutions
- Improve performance
- Apply more idiomatic JavaScript patterns

This demonstrates learning progression rather than just completion.

- A `script.js` file containing your solution

Example structure:
```
new-branch/

exercise-1/
├── README.md
└── script.js
```

---

### 4️⃣ Commit and Push Your Changes

After completing your solution:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added solution for Exercise 1"
git push origin exercise-1
```

---

### 5️⃣ Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch into the main branch of your forked repository.

This allows your changes to be reviewed before merging.

---

### 6️⃣ Make Changes If Needed

If feedback is provided:
- Update your code locally 
- Commit the changes
- Push again to the same branch

```
git add .
git commit -m "Fix review comments"
git push origin exercise-1
```

The Pull Request will automatically update.
